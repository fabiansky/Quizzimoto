Should I use Cucumber?

  I really like Cucumber, but that project seems to move extremely quickly.
  It's hard for me to keep up since this is a 20% project. I'm going to keep
  it simple and stick to RSpec and Capybara for right now.

What should I do about auth?  Should I use Identity Toolkit?

  Ryan Boyd said that I don't need Identity Toolkit.  He said I can just stick with OAuth2.  See:

    http://oauthssodemo.appspot.com/
    http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/2.0/developers_guide_protocol_oauth2.html

Should I have a users table?

  I don't need one yet.

Should I store OAuth2 tokens somewhere more permanent?

  This question presupposes an identity system, i.e. that a user would log
  into my site, and then I would have access to his saved OAuth2 token.  I
  don't have that.  I changed it so that as soon as you click login, if you
  have already approved OAuth2 access and you are already logged into
  Google, you'll be logged in my site immediately.

What should I do about admins?

  I can probably do something simple like store a list of email addresses in
  app_config.yml and then check the user's email address when he logs in.
  However, I've decided to punt the problem entirely for the time being.

Who can edit a quiz?

  I'm not going to bother with realtime, collaborative editing.  Only an
  owner can edit his own quiz.  Each quiz has an owner_id which corresponds
  to the user's Google+ ID.

Should I allow the user to logout?

  Yes.  Reset his session and redirect him to the home page.

Should I allow users to use as much of the app as possible without logging in?

  It's the right thing to do.  For instance, it'd be nice to take quizzes
  without logging in.  However, it adds a lot of complexity.  It's out of
  scope for the time being.

Do I need the scopes listed on (http://oauthssodemo.appspot.com/step/1)?  Do I
need access to the user's email address?

  "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.me" gives me access to the user's
  Google+ profile, which is more than I need for the time being.

Should a quiz contain a playlist or just a single video?

  I started the project thinking I would use a playlist, but it's much
  simpler to just use a single video.

How can a user pick the video for his quiz?

  The goal is to do something useful with the GData API. Let's show him a
  list of his existing videos. Let's also let him search for videos. Last of
  all, we can provide him a link to
  (http://www.youtube.com/my_videos_upload) so that he can upload a new
  video or record a new video using his webcam.  Since this is done in a
  separate tab, we'll need a refresh button next to the list of the user's
  own videos.

Can a user delete a quiz?  Do we give the user the ability to delete the
corresponding video and any related spreadsheets?

  Let users delete quizzes.  Don't worry about deleting the video or any
  related spreadsheets.

Should I use a Google Docs form for my quiz?

  Yes.  Google Docs already has a form creator that has all the types of
  questions that I'm interested in.  You can even embed the form in an
  iframe.  This is a good opportunity to use multiple Google APIs together.

What is it like to create a Google Docs form?  Is this something that a
teacher creating a quiz can do?  Will it be too jarring to ask them to work
with multiple websites at the same time?

  The Google Docs form creator is actually pretty nice.  I think it's doable.

Can I embed the form in an iframe.

  Yes.  The UI has that ability.  I assume I can do it with the API by tweaking
  some URLs.

Can I create a spreadsheet automatically and get the URL?

  Yes.  You can use the Documents List API (http://code.google.com/apis/documents/) to create a new spreadsheet.  This will give you the URL.

Can I do the same thing for a form?

  Create a spreadsheet.  Then, you can transform the spreadsheet URL to generate
  the URL for the form.  Transform the URL from:

    https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvZ56A18VRlxdExqSW96eWZSMC1DZ3hqelZTWEEyOHc#gid=0

  To:

    https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/gform?key=0AvZ56A18VRlxdExqSW96eWZSMC1DZ3hqelZTWEEyOHc&hl=en_US#edit

Can I embed the form in a window that slides out at certain times?

  This is surely possible with jQuery UI, but I think it might not be worth
  the effort.

Is there any way to show the user questions one at a time?

  It's probably possible, but hacking that deeply into the Google Docs form
  seems hacky.  I think it may not be worth the effort.

Can I get any metadata about the form, such as the number of questions?

  It's probably possible to use the spreadsheets API to to do a range
  request.

Can I use the first form response as the answer key?

  Use the spreadsheets API to get the second row of the spreadsheet.  Tell
  teacher to be the first one to respond to the quiz.

Can I use JavaScript to interact with the Google Docs form?  When the user
submits the form, how will I know?

  The form is embedded in an iframe served from a separate domain. That makes
  it impossible to inject JavaScript.  There are two main approaches.  I'm
  strongly leaning toward the second.

  The first approach is to use Apps Script with Ui Services to call back into
  the Rails application.  Then, the server could use Comet somehow to push the
  change back into the user's page.  This is hard because I don't currently have
  a way to do Comet.  It's also fairly complex.  Here are a few links for the
  various Ui Services things needed for this approach:

    http://code.google.com/googleapps/appsscript/articles/appengine.html
    http://code.google.com/googleapps/appsscript/class_urlfetchapp.html
    http://code.google.com/googleapps/appsscript/class_serversubmithandler.html

  The second approach is to proxy the request to load the form through the
  Rails server.  That way it'll come from the same domain, which allows me to
  inject some JavaScript into the page, specifically a submit handler.  Aside
  from fixing the timing issues, it also allows me to tweak the form a bit
  before it gets submitted.  However, I don't want to monkey with the form
  too much since that would set a bad example.  Furthermore, this may be
  against the terms of service.  I should talk to the spreadsheets team about
  it.

The outer page knows who the user is thanks to OAuth2.  How do I inject that
into the form response?

  When you load the form, you can pass parameters to fill in a few of the
  blanks.  I might need to tell the teacher to add a field for the user's name,
  email address, and/or ID.  The forms themselves don't have this feature,
  presumably because of privacy concerns.
