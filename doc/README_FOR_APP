This application lets you build video-based quizzes. A teacher can choose a
playlist of videos and a set of questions to ask students about those videos.
My goal is to do something interesting in the educational space using Ruby on
Rails and YouTube? APIs.

Run "rake doc:app" to generate API documentation for your models, controllers,
helpers, and libraries.
