== Quizzimoto

This application lets you build video-based quizzes.  My goal is to do
something interesting in the educational space using Ruby on Rails and YouTube
APIs.

== Setup

This application uses Ruby version 1.9.2 and Rails version 3.0.5.  If you
already have those things installed, you can skip the next section.

=== Setting up Ruby with rvm

These instructions show how to setup Ruby 1.9.2 under rvm on OS X.  It
shouldn't require that much tweaking to get them to run on other operating
systems.  Note that I had a lot of issues getting ruby-debug19 to work under
MacPorts which is why I switched to rvm.  It also turns out that some HTTPS
client (i.e. SSL) issues I had went away as soon as I switched to rvm.

  sudo port install sqlite3
 
Setup rvm:

  # On Ubuntu, you'll need a couple dependencies:
  # sudo apt-get install curl libreadline5-dev

Note, rvm assumes you use bash.

  bash -s stable < <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/master/binscripts/rvm-installer)

This creates ~/.rvm and updates ~/.bash_profile.

Run the following in all your open terminals:

  source ~/.bash_profile

Do *not* use sudo when using "gem install" or "bundle install" under rvm.
  
  rvm install 1.9.2
  rvm use 1.9.2            # To switch Ruby versions temporarily
  which ruby irb gem rake  # Should all be in ~/.rvm
  ruby -v                  # Should be 1.9.2
  rvm --default 1.9.2      # To set your default version of Ruby

Gems will be located in ~/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p290/gems.
    
  gem install bundler

=== Setting Up the Application

Now you're ready to setup the application itself:

  bundle install
  rake db:migrate

=== API Keys and OAuth2

You'll may want to sign up for your own API key and setup OAuth2.  Do both of
those things here (https://code.google.com/apis/console/).  Remember to enable
the Google+ API.  Once you have an OAuth2 client ID and client secret, update
config/app_config.yml.

== Other Useful Commands

Starting the server:

  rails server

Running tests:

  rake spec

Generating API documentation:

  rake doc:app
