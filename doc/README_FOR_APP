== Quizzimoto

This application lets you build video-based quizzes.  My goal is to do
something interesting in the educational space using Ruby on Rails and YouTube
APIs.

== Setup

This application uses Ruby version 1.9.3 and Rails version 3.0.5.  If you
already have those things installed, you can skip the next section.

=== Setting up Ruby with rvm

These instructions show how to setup Ruby 1.9.3 on OS X 10.7 (Lion) using
Homebrew and rvm.  It shouldn't require that much tweaking to get them to run
on other operating systems.  Note that I had a lot of issues getting ruby-
debug19 to work under MacPorts which is why I switched to rvm.  It also turns
out that some HTTPS client (i.e. SSL) issues I had went away as soon as I
switched to rvm.

  brew install sqlite3

Setup rvm:

  # On Ubuntu, you'll need a couple dependencies:
  # sudo apt-get install curl libreadline5-dev

Note, rvm assumes you use bash.

  bash -s stable < <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/master/binscripts/rvm-installer)

This creates ~/.rvm and updates ~/.bash_profile.

Run the following in all your open terminals:

  source ~/.bash_profile

Do *not* use sudo when using "gem install" or "bundle install" under rvm.

  rvm install 1.9.3 --with-gcc=clang  # --with-gcc only on Lion and later
  rvm use 1.9.3                       # To switch Ruby versions temporarily
  which ruby irb gem rake             # Should all be in ~/.rvm
  ruby -v                             # Should be 1.9.3
  rvm --default 1.9.3                 # To set your default version of Ruby
  gem install bundler

=== Setting Up the Application

Now you're ready to setup the application itself:

  bundle install
  rake db:migrate

=== API Keys

You may want to sign up for your own API key and setup OAuth2.  Do both of
those things here (https://code.google.com/apis/console/).  Remember to enable
the Google+ API.  Once you have an OAuth2 client ID and client secret, update
config/app_config.yml.

You may also want to sign up for your own YouTube developer key.  Do that here
(http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/dashboard/gwt/index.html) and update
config/app_config.yml.

== Other Useful Commands

Starting the server:

  rails server

Running tests:

  rake spec

Generating API documentation:

  rake doc:app
