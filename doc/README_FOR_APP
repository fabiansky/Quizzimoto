== Quizzimoto

This application lets you build video-based quizzes. A teacher can choose a
playlist of videos and a set of questions to ask students about those videos.
My goal is to do something interesting in the educational space using Ruby on
Rails and YouTube? APIs.

== Setup

This application uses Ruby version 1.9.2 and Rails version 3.0.5.  If you
already have those things installed, you can skip the next section.

=== Setting up Ruby with rvm

These instructions show how to setup Ruby 1.9.2 under rvm on OS X.  It
shouldn't require that much tweaking to get them to run on other operating
systems.  Note that I had a lot of issues getting ruby-debug19 to work under
MacPorts which is why I switched to rvm.

  sudo port install sqlite3
 
Setup rvm:

  # On Ubuntu, you'll need to install curl:
  # sudo apt-get install curl

Note, rvm assumes you use bash.

  bash -s stable < <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/master/binscripts/rvm-installer)

This creates ~/.rvm and updates ~/.bash_profile.

Run the following in all your open terminals:

  source ~/.bash_profile

Do *not* use sudo when using "gem install" or "bundle install" under rvm.
  
  rvm install 1.9.2
  rvm use 1.9.2            # To switch Ruby versions temporarily
  which ruby irb gem rake  # Should all be in ~/.rvm
  ruby -v                  # Should be 1.9.2
  rvm --default 1.9.2      # To set your default version of Ruby

Gems will be located in ~/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p290/gems.
    
  gem install bundler

=== SSL Root Certificates

Ruby doesn't know where to look for root SSL certificates.  Ubuntu comes with
root certificates already installed.  On OS X, you can install some root
certificates using MacPorts:

  sudo port install curl-ca-bundle

If that doesn't work for you, or if you still see errors such as:

  SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify failed (OpenSSL::SSL::SSLError)

then you may need to figure out where the root SSL certificates are for your
operating system and tweak config/initializers/fix_ssl.rb.

=== Setting Up the Application

Now you're ready to setup the application itself:

  sudo bundle install
  rake db:migrate

=== API Keys and OAuth2

You'll may want to sign up for your own API key and setup OAuth2.  Do both of
those things here (https://code.google.com/apis/console/).

Once you have an OAuth2 client ID and client secret, update
config/app_config.yml.

== Other Useful Commands

Starting the server:

  rails server

Running tests:

  rake spec

Generating API documentation:

  rake doc:app
