== Quizzimoto

This application lets you build video-based quizzes. A teacher can choose a
playlist of videos and a set of questions to ask students about those videos.
My goal is to do something interesting in the educational space using Ruby on
Rails and YouTube? APIs.

== Setup

This application uses Ruby version 1.9 and Rails version 3.0.5.  Assuming you
have a reasonable Ruby environment setup, you should be able to install all
the necessary gems via:

  sudo bundle install

Then, setup your database:

  rake db:migrate

=== API Keys and OAuth2

You'll probably want to sign up for your own API key and setup OAuth2.  Do
both of those things here (https://code.google.com/apis/console/).

Once you have an OAuth2 client ID and client secret, update
config/app_config.yml.

=== SSL Root Certificates

Ruby doesn't know where to look for root SSL certificates.  On OS X, you can
install some root certificates using MacPorts:

  sudo port install curl-ca-bundle

If that doesn't work for you, or if you still see errors such as:

  SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify failed (OpenSSL::SSL::SSLError)

then you may need to figure out where the root SSL certificates are for your
operating system and tweak config/initializers/fix_ssl.rb.

== Other Commands

  rails server
